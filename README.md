# Inverse Virtualized

## Setup

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Go to http://localhost:3000

## Notes

- Ran out of time for unit tests but would've liked to have tested the main
  app and also the smaller components and ideally some integration tests using
  Cypress or Selenium.

- List gets automatically stored to local storage on any edits to the list.

- Because I'm using local storage, there is a limit to the number of items that
  can exist. With more time some user warning/error handling could be added in
  for that.
